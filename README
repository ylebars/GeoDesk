GeoDesk is a tool to get geographical data from digitalised maps.

  To compile it, you need a C++-2011 compiler and CMake
(<http://www.cmake.org/>) version 2.6 or greater. It depends on library Boost
(<http://www.boost.org/>) version 1.31.1 or greater, library Qt4
(<http://qt-project.org/>) version 4.6 or greater, library Eigen
(<http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>) version 3.0.0 or
greater, and Doxygen (<http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>) to generate the
documentation.

  Compile GeoDesk is pretty straightforward. We recommend you create a directory
called "build" in GeoDesk directory. Then go to this directory and simply use
CMake to create compilation file for your environment. For instance, on UNIX
based operating systems, the following commands will compile GeoDesk (when you
are on "build" directory):

    $ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
    $ make

  The resulting object file will then be located in
"build/src/bin/${COMPILATION_MODE}/," where "${COMPILATION_MODE}" is the name
of the compilation mode used, such as "Debug" or "Release." To install the
software, type as root:

    # make install

  To create documentation, simply use the "doc" entry in your compilation
files. For instance, on UNIX based operating systems:

    $ make doc

  Resulting documentations will be in "doc/."

  Of course, types of compilation can be changed using CMake, see CMake
documentation for more details.

  To obtain some help, simply type:

    $ geodesk --help

  The documentation generates man pages.

  If the compiler you are using is GCC, we suggest you set the following
variables (adapt this to your compiler if needed):

//Flags used by the compiler during debug builds.
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG:STRING=-g -std=c++11 -pedantic -Wall -pipe

//Flags used by the compiler during release minsize builds.
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL:STRING=-std=c++11 -march=native -Os -DNDEBUG -pipe

//Flags used by the compiler during release builds (/MD /Ob1 /Oi
// /Ot /Oy /Gs will produce slightly less optimized but smaller
// files).
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE:STRING=-std=c++11 -march=native -O2 -DNDEBUG -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer

//Flags used by the compiler during Release with Debug Info builds.
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO:STRING=-std=c++11 -march=native -O2 -g -pipe -fno-omit-frame-pointer
